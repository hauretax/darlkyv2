The idea is to try a list of passwords on a login address
- run brutforce.js
- wait
http://192.168.56.101/?page=signin&username=admin&password=shadow&Login=Login
work

# problem

We can try an infinite number of times and therefore try a huge amount of passwords


# solution

 rate-limiting, CAPTCHA, and two-factor authentication can also be implemented to further secure the form and protect against potential attacks. Force users to use stronger passwords.
