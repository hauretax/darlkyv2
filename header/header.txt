In the footer we have a link to a page
<a href="?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f">

when you use curl you see in the comments:

You must come from : "https://www.nsa.gov/".

use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot.

let's set the right user agent and the referer page in our curl

curl -A "ft_bornToSec" -e "https://www.nsa.gov/" http://127.0.0.1:8080/\?page\=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f

The flag is : f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188


fix:

Do not give any sensitive information based on where the request comes from as it can be forged. A request with the right header can be made via curl
